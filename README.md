Demo address:https://quotegenerator.cc/

## How it works

This project adds a multi-language internationalized version based on the original repository of teacher Weijun. The original repository address is: https://github.com/weijunext/smart-excel-ai
This repository code is only required if multi-language internationalization function is required.

This project uses the [ChatGPT API](https://openai.com/api/) and the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) with streaming. It constructs a prompt based on the form and user input, sends it to the ChatGPT API with a Vercel Edge Function, then streams the response back to the application UI.
